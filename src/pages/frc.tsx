      FRC is a competition in which high school robotics teams compete to
      build an industrial robot in a limited amount of time that competes in a
      game with strict rules. I am part of the programming sub team on FRC
      team 973, a three-time world champion team. The programming sub team
      programs the robot to perform different actions when either the drivers
      press buttons on their controllers, or when the robot is driving itself
      in autonomous, or the first fifteen seconds of the match.
